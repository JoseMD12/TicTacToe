## Usage

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player is assigned "X" and the other "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

To play the Tic Tac Toe game:

1. Open the game in your web browser using the provided link (http://localhost:3000).
2. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns clicking on an empty space in the grid.
4. The first player's mark is "X" and the second player's mark is "O".
5. The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, or there are no more empty spaces in the grid (resulting in a tie).
6. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a message will be displayed indicating the result.
7. To start a new game, simply refresh the page in your browser.
